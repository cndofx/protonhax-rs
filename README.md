# protonhax-rs

A rewrite of jcnils' protonhax in rust.
Not currently compatible with the files the original version generates.

## Why?

I was bored.

## Should I use this?

Probably not. It (currently at least) offers nothing over the original other than potential instability.
If you do use it and you do run into problems, open an issue!
